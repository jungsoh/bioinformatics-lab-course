# Bioinformatics lab course
I devloped and taught this course at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/) in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The course is designed for master degree students in molecular medicine, molecular biology, and molecular biology with minimal prior exposure to bioinformatics and programming. This is a lab course with short lectures with a heavy emphasis on use of both command line and web-based tools.

## Contents
The topics include (with *sequence* meaning DNA sequence):
- Sequence retrieval and database search
- Multiple sequence alignment
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Next-generation sequencing (NGS) *de novo* assembly
- NGS read alignment
- RNA-seq assembly and analysis
- Gene list functional annotation
- Metagenomic analysis

There are 5 lecture slide decks in `lectures` and 8 lab exercise sets in `labs`. Some labs do not have corresponding lecture slides.
